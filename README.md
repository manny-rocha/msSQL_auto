# msSQL_auto

This a desktop application with a GUI intedented to make querying MS SQL databases more accessible to 'non-techies'. 
Using PyQt5 and the PyODBC libraries, I've created a GUI with error handling, SQL syntax highlighting, and more. 

## User Guide
To use this application, clone the repository, install necessary packages, and simply run the program from a computer that has 
network access to the database you would like to query. 

If you would like to package the program as an executable, I recomment the cx_Freeze or PyInstaller libraries.
